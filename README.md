fbida
=====

The fbida project contains a few applications for viewing and editing images.

It's forked from https://www.kraxel.org/blog/linux/fbida/

It's based on FBIDA 2.09 (fbida-2.09.tar.gz  	Gerd Hoffmann)

My goal is extract a good viewer for my Raspberry Pi with command online only.

The applications originals of Gerd Hoffmann are:
    fbi – This is a image viewer for the linux framebuffer console.
    fbgs – A wrapper script for viewing ps/pdf files on the framebuffer console using fbi.
    ida – This is a X11 application (Motif based) for viewing images. Some basic editing functions are available too.
    exiftran – command line tool to do lossless transformations of JPEG images. Works much like jpegtran, but unlike jpegtran it does not ignore the EXIF data ;)
    thumbnail.cgi – Small and fast CGI script (written in C) to extract EXIF thumbnails from jpeg images and send them to the web browser.

In my case, i want just fbi for RaspBerry Pi
