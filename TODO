- some effect filters
- improve cut+paste [does complete images only right now ... ]
- make the file browser save the thumbnails somewhere (optionally),
  so it can be much faster the second time ...
- screenshots
- put images on root window / some batch processing.


List is ordered according to my personal priorities.  More ideas
welcome, but it doesn't automatically mean they will be added to the
list.  iv is a interactive, small + fast[1] utility and will only
support commonly needed features (focus on photos), compareable to xv.

If you need a full featured image processing tool with all bells and
whistles, better use the gimp.  To to stuff batched in scripts, use
ImageMagick (convert utility / perl interface).


[1] It has finished loading the image while the gimp still shows the
    splash screen :-)
